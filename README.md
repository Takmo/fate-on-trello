# Fate on Trello

Manage your Fate Core/Accelerated game using Trello.

This Power-Up helps you run your game right in your Trello boards.
It has handy utilities for generating new characters, locations,
and encounters. It also has tools for rolling dice, invoking aspects,
and ultimately marking the result of an action.

Still early in development. Might work eventually.
