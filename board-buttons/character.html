                <p class="fot-text">
                Characters are the heart and soul of Fate Core/Accelerated, and
                your character will be your avatar within the game world. Just like
                you, your character is a complex individual in an envolving world.
                Their thoughts, feelings, and backgrounds might reflect your own, or
                they might be a new adventure entirely.
                </p>
                <p class="fot-text">
                Aspects are five short phrases that describe the most significant
                elements about your character. You can see sample aspects below, but
                you have free reign to pick and choose your character's aspects as
                desired. Pay special attention to your character's <em>High Concept</em>
                and <em>Trouble</em>, as they serve special purposes in the game.
                </p>
                <p class="fot-text">
                In addition to serving as roleplaying guides, aspects can also influence
                your rolls while confronting obstacles. You begin each game session with
                3 Fate Points (unless your game master says otherwise), and when a situation
                warrants it, you can pay one of your points to add +1 before any roll,
                as long as the obstacle would logically be easier to overcome because of
                one of your character's aspects.
                </p>
                <p class="fot-text">
                <em>
                    Because my character has the aspect <strong>Windhelm's Best Locksmith</strong>,
                    I would like to pay one Fate Point (and <strong>invoke that aspect</strong>)
                    to gain +2 when unlocking this door.
                </em>
                </p>
                <p class="fot-text">
                Aspects are also useful in replenishing your spent Fate Points. Whereas
                you can pay a Fate Point to gain a positive advantage based on an aspect,
                the game master (or even other players) may pay you a Fate Point to
                <strong>compell</strong> your character into a negative situation.
                </p>
                <p class="fot-text">
                <em>
                    Because your character has the aspect <strong>Can't Resist a Challenge</strong>,
                    she is <strong>compelled</strong> to pick a fight with the guard bragging at
                    the bar. Good luck getting into the museum now. You gain one Fate Point.

                <h2>Character Skills</h2>
                <p class="fot-text">
                Skills describe what your character is good and not-so-good at. When
                your character engages in activities related to one of these skills,
                you can include these bonsues on related rolls.

                <p class="fot-text">
                For new characters, Fate Core recommends the following distribution
                of skills:
                <ul>
                    <li>1x Great (+4) skill</li>
                    <li>2x Good (+3) skills</li>
                    <li>3x Fair (+2) skills</li>

                <p class="fot-text">
                Approaches are adverbs that describe how your character prefers to
                solve their problems. There are six approaches in all, and a character
                can use any approach to solve their problem. However, they naturally
                excel at certain types of approaches. When a character attempts to
                complete an action using an approach they are skilled with, you can
                include that bonus on related roles.
