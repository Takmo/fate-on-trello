                <p class="fot-text">
                Skills describe what your character is good and not-so-good at. When
                your character engages in activities related to one of these skills,
                you can include these bonsues on related rolls.

                For new characters, Fate Core recommends the following distribution
                of skills:
                <ul>
                    <li>1x Great (+4) skill</li>
                    <li>2x Good (+3) skills</li>
                    <li>3x Fair (+2) skills</li>
                    <li>4x Average (+1) skills</li>

                <h2>Character Approaches</h2>
                <p class="fot-text">
                Approaches are adverbs that describe how your character prefers to
                solve their problems. There are six approaches in all, and a character
                can use any approach to solve their problem. However, they naturally
                excel at certain types of approaches. When a character attempts to
                complete an action using an approach they are skilled with, you can
                include that bonus on related roles.
                </p>
                <p class="fot-text">
                For new characters, Fate Accelerated recommends the following
                distribution of skills:
                <ul>
                    <li>1x Good (+3) approach</li>

                Stunts describe special ways your character uses skills/approaches
                to perform an action. Think of these like a signature move your
                character uses in a fight, or a special skill they have in certain
                environments.
